# Hi! I'm Maxime üëã

- üë®‚Äçüéì I'm currently an M2 student in Game Programming at Rubika
- üí° I'm aiming for a generalist game programmer profile since I like to touch and improve myself in all branches of video game development.
- üéÆ I like to stay informed of the latest games released as well as to try them, both AAA and independent games.
